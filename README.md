# drum-pad-js
Basic react app

This app contains a drum machine with 9 buttons which plays 9 different sounds.
The running method of this app is based into a static HTML with the necesary scripts which is not very efficient but the goal here is to learn the React library.

You can try it online and see the code with this working demo: https://codepen.io/julianmenav/pen/GROaevP
